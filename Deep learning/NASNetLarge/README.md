This file contains the model and the notebook of NASNetLarge Transfer Learning

# OBSERVATION
NASNetLarge is not efficient for transfer learning for African Wildlife images as it initially had an accurcaty of 64% and during retraining, RESOURCE ERROR was encountered which was as a result of limited GPU capacity

Also when i tried predicting without the transfer learning at all, the predictios where very very dissimilar, for example i tried predicting a buffalo, and the closest options were chains et.
