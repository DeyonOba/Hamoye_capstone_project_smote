# Hamoye : Team SMOTE


### Object detection using TensorFlow and YOLO v5
---

**Approach:**
Dataset used: [African Wildlife](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/biancaferreira/african-wildlife)

The original dataset was YOLO specific so our team split into two parts:

1. Team Tensorflow

  ![Tensorflow Logo](https://www.logolynx.com/images/logolynx/s_29/29e59a2b11f45a2dbbdc5f034e2a5a0e.png)
  
  For the tensorflow models, we collected animal images of animlas through data scrapping as our YOLO dataset had images with multiple animals in them reducing the
  accuracy of the model.
  Then cleaned those images, augmented them and finally 

WorkFlow:
* Data Collection
* Data Cleaning
* Data Augmentation
* Modelling
* Evaluation
* Deployment
